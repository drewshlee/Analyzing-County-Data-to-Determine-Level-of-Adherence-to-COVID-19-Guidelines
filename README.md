# Based on County-level Analysis, Which Counties Need to Adhere More Closely to Strict Social Distancing Measures and Guidelines?
As economies and populations continue to weather the harsh realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain sacrifices may need to be made. For counties that have a smaller age 60+ population, relatively small population, and manageable hospital bed count, social distanding guidelines may not need to be as strict as in counties that have a high 60+ age population and low hospital bed count. Analyses into this county level data can provide guidelines for social distancing, business reopening plans, and more.

# Business Question
How can analyses into county level data (percentage of population over 60, percentage of population under 18, number of hospital beds, hospital count, etc.) help manage the COVID-19 crisis?
